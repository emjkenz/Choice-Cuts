# Choice-Cuts 

## Description

Our goal with Choice Cuts was to create a unique, but fun online website where potential customers can order specific cuts of meat. 

What started as a joke project has grown into a serious business idea centered around bringing what is traditionally a brick and mortar, in person sales experience, into the digital space that could connect customers and suppliers that would otherwise never have a chance to interact and trade.

Our team identified a gap in the market, and have attempted to solve the issue by giving the customers more autonomy and choice, while broadening the views and product awareness of butcheries, farms and ranches.

Working on this project has been both entertaining and educational as each developer has had to work alongside each other, communicate effectively and put our skills and knowledge to the ultimate test to create a fully functioning, full stack website within a short timeframe.
