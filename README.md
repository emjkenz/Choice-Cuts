# Choice-Cuts 

## Description

Our goal was too create a unique but fun online website so we could order custom cuts.
 We built this because it was spotted a need in the market and thought about filling it.
 The need we spotted was that people didn't have full atonomy when it comes to ordering meat. They don't get to control how much fat is on it or how many ribs they get.
This project was great as we gotta practice our team working skills for creating a functional website.
